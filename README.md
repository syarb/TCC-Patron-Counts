### What are patron counts? — 🤔 

Every hour at the TCC Southeast and Metro library a patron count is recorded.   Collected by the Library Aides and Assistants, a single "patron count" is five values: The number of patrons using ***computers***, the number of patrons in the ***quiet*** area, the ***silent*** area, the ***active*** area, and one last section, ***other*** to include patrons in any other location (walking around in an ambiguous area, at the service desk, etc).

Students using study rooms aren't included in this data. This is because the library uses a different way to record that data. If you are a library employee, you can use [this link](https://libcal.library.tulsacc.edu/admin/spaces/stats) to view those stats.

### What about door counts? — 🙋‍♀️
I have that data, but I haven't added it here **yet**! Come back soon.
