Every hour at the Tulsa Community College Library *(at the Metro/Southeast campuses)* a patron count is recorded, this data is collected by the Library Aides and Assistants who use a Google Sheet to input a row containing five values: The number of patrons using ***computers***, the number of patrons in the ***quiet*** area, the ***silent*** area, the ***active*** area, and one last section, **other** to include patrons in any other location (walking around, at the service desk).

Notably, students using study rooms aren't included in this data. This is because the library uses a different way to record that data, although, if it's desired, I could include that data here as well. If you are a library employee, you can use [this link](https://libcal.library.tulsacc.edu/admin/spaces/stats) to view those stats.
