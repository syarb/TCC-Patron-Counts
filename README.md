### What are patron counts? — 🤔 

Every hour at the TCC Southeast and Metro library a patron count is recorded.   Collected by the Library Aides and Assistants, a single "patron count" is five values: The number of patrons using ***computers***, the number of patrons in the ***quiet*** area, the ***silent*** area, the ***active*** area, and one last section, ***other*** to including patrons in any other location (walking around in an ambiguous area, at the service desk, etc).

*Notably*, students using study rooms aren't included in this data. This is because the library uses a different way to record that data. If you are a library employee, you can use [this link](https://libcal.library.tulsacc.edu/admin/spaces/stats) to view those stats.

### What about door counts? — 🙋‍♀️
I have that data, but I haven't added it here **yet**! Come back soon.
