## Downloads ⬇️ (click link to download)

**Current Semester**
- [Southeast](https://github.com/syarb/tcc-patron-counts/releases/download/latest/Current.Semester.-.Southeast.csv)
- [Metro](https://github.com/syarb/tcc-patron-counts/releases/download/latest/Current.Semester.-.Metro.csv) (also currently contains **ALL** of the Metro Counts, but eventually I will split this like the SE campus)

**Previous Semesters**
- Southeast
  - [.csv all-in-one file](https://github.com/syarb/tcc-patron-counts/releases/download/latest/Previous.Semesters.-.Southeast.csv)
  - [.zip file with each semester as its own .csv file](https://github.com/syarb/tcc-patron-counts/releases/download/latest/Southeast.Patron.Counts.by.Semester.zip)
- Metro
  - Coming soon, download the [metro current semester](https://github.com/syarb/tcc-patron-counts/releases/download/latest/Current.Semester.-.Metro.csv) since it has all of the data.

*The reasoning behind making them split is that the current semester's data lives on Google Sheets. The "live" semester gets loaded every time someone visits the count website, so having that file be only as big as absolutely necessary helps.*

## What are patron counts? 🤔 

Every hour* at the TCC Southeast and Metro library a patron count is recorded.   Collected by the Library Aides and Assistants, a single "patron count" is five values: The number of patrons using ***computers***, the number of patrons in the ***quiet*** area, the ***silent*** area, the ***active*** area, and one last section, ***other*** to include patrons in any other location (walking around in an ambiguous area, at the service desk, etc).

* not necessarily every hour, but as often as possible, on the half hour every hour.

Students using study rooms aren't included in this data. This is because the library uses a different way to record that data. If you are a library employee, you can use [this link](https://libcal.library.tulsacc.edu/admin/spaces/stats) to view those stats.

## What about door counts? 🙋‍
I have that data, but I haven't added it here **yet**! Come back soon.
